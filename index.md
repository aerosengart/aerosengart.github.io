I am a third year Ph.D. student in statistics at Carnegie Mellon University advised by [F. William Townes](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/research/members/will-townes.html).

I am a member of the [Delphi Research Group](https://delphi.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon in which I focus on applying and developing statistical methods for wastewater-based epidemiology. 

My past research interests include analysis of multi-omics data and compartment modeling for disease transmission.

Most recently, I was a summer researcher in the [Das Lab](https://www.jishnulab.org) where I worked on adapting large language models for protein-protein interaction prediction.
 
You can check out some of my recent ramblings in the [Posts](https://aerosengart.github.io/posts) tab and my publications and pre-prints in [Research](https://aerosengart.github.io/research). I've also included some of my hobbies and interests in [More About Me](https://aerosengart.github.io/misc)!
