I am a fourth year Ph.D. candidate in statistics at Carnegie Mellon University advised by <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/research/members/will-townes.html">F. William Townes</a>.

I am a member of the <a href="https://delphi.cmu.edu">Delphi Research Group</a> at Carnegie Mellon in which I focus on applying and developing statistical methods for wastewater-based epidemiology. 

My past research interests include analysis of multi-omics data and compartment modeling for disease transmission.
