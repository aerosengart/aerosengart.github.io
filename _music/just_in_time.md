Earlier this year I finished up a big band arrangement of the song <i>Just In Time</i> by Styne, Comden, and Green. It's originally from the 1956 musical <i>Bells Are Ringing</i>, but it's become a jazz standard. It's been recorded by most of the big name vocalists, including Tony Bennett, Bobby Darin, Nina Simone, and Frank Sinatra.
