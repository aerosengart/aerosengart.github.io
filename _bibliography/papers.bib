  abstract = {Admission-based circulating biomarkers for the prediction of outcomes in trauma patients could be useful for clinical decision support. It is unknown which molecular classes of biomolecules can contribute biomarkers to predictive modeling. Here, we analyzed a large multi-omic database of over 8500 markers (proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics) to identify prognostic biomarkers in the circulating compartment for adverse outcomes, including mortality and slow recovery, in severely injured trauma patients. Admission plasma samples from patients (n = 129) enrolled in the Prehospital Air Medical Plasma (PAMPer) trial were analyzed using mass spectrometry (metabolomics and lipidomics) and aptamer-based (proteomics) assays. Biomarkers were selected via Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression modeling and machine learning analysis. A combination of ﬁve proteins from the proteomic layer was best at discriminating resolvers from nonresolvers from critical illness with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.74, while 26 multi-omic features predicted 30-day survival with an AUC of 0.77. Patients with traumatic brain injury as part of their injury complex had a unique subset of features that predicted 30-day survival. Our ﬁndings indicate that multi-omic analyses can identify novel admission-based prognostic biomarkers for outcomes in trauma patients. Unique biomarker discovery also has the potential to provide biologic insights.},

  abstract = {Since the start of the coronavirus-19 pandemic, the use of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for disease surveillance has increased throughout the world. Because wastewater measurements are affected by external factors, processing WBE data typically includes a normalization step in order to adjust wastewater measurements (e.g., viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) concentrations) to account for variation due to dynamic population changes, sewer travel effects, or laboratory methods. Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), a plant RNA virus abundant in human feces and wastewater, has been used as a fecal contamination indicator and has been used to normalize wastewater measurements extensively. However, there has been little work to characterize the spatiotemporal variability of PMMoV in wastewater, which may influence the effectiveness of PMMoV for adjusting or normalizing WBE measurements. Here, we investigate its variability across space and time using data collected over a two-year period from sewage treatment plants across the United States. We find that most variation in PMMoV measurements can be attributed to longitude and latitude followed by site-specific variables. Further research into cross-geographical and -temporal comparability of PMMoV-normalized pathogen concentrations would strengthen the utility of PMMoV in WBE.},

  abstract = {Public health decisions must be made about when and how to implement interventions to control an infectious disease epidemic. These decisions should be informed by data on the epidemic as well as current understanding about the transmission dynamics. Such decisions can be posed as statistical questions about scientifically motivated dynamic models. Thus, we encounter the methodological task of building credible, data-informed decisions based on stochastic, partially observed, nonlinear dynamic models. This necessitates addressing the tradeoff between biological fidelity and model simplicity, and the reality of misspecification for models at all levels of complexity. We assess current methodological approaches to these issues via a case study of the 2010-2019 cholera epidemic in Haiti. We consider three dynamic models developed by expert teams to advise on vaccination policies. We evaluate previous methods used for fitting these models, and we demonstrate modified data analysis strategies leading to improved statistical fit. Specifically, we present approaches for diagnosing model misspecification and the consequent development of improved models. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of recent advances in likelihood maximization for high-dimensional nonlinear dynamic models, enabling likelihood-based inference for spatiotemporal incidence data using this class of models. Our workflow is reproducible and extendable, facilitating future investigations of this disease system.},
