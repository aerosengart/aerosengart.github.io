These decisions should be informed by data on the epidemic as well as current understanding about the transmission dynamics. Such decisions can be posed as statistical questions about scientifically motivated dynamic models. Thus, we encounter the methodological task of building credible, data-informed decisions based on stochastic, partially observed, nonlinear dynamic models. This necessitates addressing the tradeoff between biological fidelity and model simplicity, and the reality of misspecification for models at all levels of complexity. We assess current methodological approaches to these issues via a case study of the 2010-2019 cholera epidemic in Haiti. We consider three dynamic models developed by expert teams to advise on vaccination policies. We evaluate previous methods used for fitting these models, and we demonstrate modified data analysis strategies leading to improved statistical fit. Specifically, we present approaches for diagnosing model misspecification and the consequent development of improved models. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of recent advances in likelihood maximization for high-dimensional nonlinear dynamic models, enabling likelihood-based inference for spatiotemporal incidence data using this class of models. Our workflow is reproducible and extendable, facilitating future investigations of this disease system.</em></p>

It is unknown which molecular classes of biomolecules can contribute biomarkers to predictive modeling. Here, we analyzed a large multi-omic database of over 8500 markers (proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics) to identify prognostic biomarkers in the circulating compartment for adverse outcomes, including mortality and slow recovery, in severely injured trauma patients. Admission plasma samples from patients (n = 129) enrolled in the Prehospital Air Medical Plasma (PAMPer) trial were analyzed using mass spectrometry (metabolomics and lipidomics) and aptamer-based (proteomics) assays. Biomarkers were selected via Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression modeling and machine learning analysis. A combination of five proteins from the proteomic layer was best at discriminating resolvers from non-resolvers from critical illness with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.74, while 26 multi-omic features predicted 30-day survival with an AUC of 0.77. Patients with traumatic brain injury as part of their injury complex had a unique subset of features that predicted 30-day survival. Our findings indicate that multi-omic analyses can identify novel admission-based prognostic biomarkers for outcomes in trauma patients. Unique biomarker discovery also has the potential to provide biologic insights.</em></p>
