Chapters 1 through 3 provide an overview of statistics and discuss some of the basic philosophical ideas and problems behind statistical procedures. Chapters 4 and 5 cover hypothesis testing with simple and null hypotheses, respectively. Subsequent chapters discuss non-parametrics, interval estimation, point estimation, asymptotics, Bayesian procedure, and deviation theory. Student familiarity with standard statistical techniques is assumed},

	abstract = {Lin (1997), building on work by Solomon \& Cox (1992) and Lin \& Breslow (1996), introduced a score test for homogeneity in the generalised linear mixed model. In this paper we propose an improvement to Lin's test that exploits the fact that covariance parameters associated with random effects in the model are constrained so as to form a positive semidefinite covariance matrix. Therefore, an omnibus score test will have power against alternatives that are known never to occur. Our improvement works by concentrating the score test into directions given by the positive semidefiniteness constraint. We apply the same sort of modification to the bias-corrected version of her score test in the generalised linear mixed model context and, in a nonlinear mixed model context, to a score test analogous to hers. We show how to obtain the limiting distribution of our proposed test statistic. We also argue, via simulations and local alternative power calculations, that the restricted test has better power than the unrestricted one.},

	abstract = {There is considerable interest in testing for overdispersion, correlation and heterogeneity across groups in biomedical studies. In this paper, we cast the problem in the framework of generalised linear models with random effects. We propose a global score test for the null hypothesis that all the variance components are zero. This test is a locally asymptotically most stringent test and is robust in the special sense that the test does not require specifying the joint distribution of the random effects. We also propose individual score tests and their approximations for testing the variance components separately. Both tests can be easily implemented using existing statistical software. We illustrate these tests with an application to the study of heterogeneity of mating success across males and females in an experiment on salamander matings, and evaluate their performance through simulation.},
