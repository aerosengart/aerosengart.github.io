Except for a limited number of tissues with known pure cell type profiles, a majority of genomics and epigenetics data relies on the “reference-free deconvolution” methods to estimate cell composition. We develop a novel computational method to improve reference-free deconvolution, which iteratively searches for cell type-specific features and performs composition estimation. Simulation studies and applications to six real datasets including both DNA methylation and gene expression data demonstrate favorable performance of the proposed method.

	abstract = {Deconvolution of RNA sequencing data is a computational method used to estimate the relative proportions of different cell types or subpopulations within a heterogeneous sample based on gene expression profiles. This technique is particularly useful in studies where the goal is to identify changes in gene expression that are specific to a particular cell type or subpopulation. The deconvolution process involves using reference gene expression profiles from known cell types or subpopulations to infer the relative abundance of these cells within a mixed sample. This is typically done using linear regression or other statistical methods to model the observed gene expression data as a linear combination of the reference profiles. Once the relative proportions of each cell type or subpopulation have been estimated, downstream analyses can be performed on each component separately, allowing for more precise identification of cell-type-specific changes in gene expression. Overall, deconvolution of RNA sequencing data is a powerful tool for dissecting complex biological systems and identifying cell-type-specific molecular signatures that may be relevant for disease diagnosis and treatment.},

	abstract = {Bulk tissue samples examined by gene expression studies are usually heterogeneous. The data gained from these samples display the confounding patterns of mixtures consisting of multiple cell types or similar cell types in various functional states, which hinders the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex biological phenomena. A realistic approach to compensate for the limitations of experimentally separating homogenous cell populations from mixed tissues is to computationally identify cell-type specific patterns from bulk, heterogeneous measurements. We designed the CellDistinguisher algorithm to analyze the gene expression data of mixed samples, identifying genes that best distinguish biological processes and cell types. Coupled with a deconvolution algorithm that takes cell type specific gene lists as input, we show that CellDistinguisher performs as well as partial deconvolution algorithms in predicting cell type composition without the need for prior knowledge of cell type signatures. This approach is also better in predicting cell type signatures than the one-step traditional complete deconvolution methods. To illustrate its wide applicability, the algorithm was tested on multiple publicly available data sets. In each case, CellDistinguisher identified genes reflecting biological processes typical for the tissues and development stages of interest and estimated the sample compositions accurately.},

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) is a recent technology that allows for the measurement of the expression of all genes in each individual cell contained in a sample. Information at the single-cell level has been shown to be extremely useful in many areas. However, performing singlecell experiments is expensive. Although cellular deconvolution cannot provide the same comprehensive information as single-cell experiments, it can extract cell-type information from bulk RNA data, and therefore it allows researchers to conduct studies at cell-type resolution from existing bulk datasets. For these reasons, a great effort has been made to develop such methods for cellular deconvolution. The large number of methods available, the requirement of coding skills, inadequate documentation, and lack of performance assessment all make it extremely difficult for life scientists to choose a suitable method for their experiment. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive review of 53 deconvolution methods regarding their methodology, applications, performance, and outstanding challenges. More importantly, the article presents a benchmarking of all these 53 methods using 283 cell types from 30 tissues of 63 individuals. We also provide an R package named DeconBenchmark that allows readers to execute and benchmark the reviewed methods (https://github.com/tinnlab/DeconBenchmark).},

            Changes in bulk transcriptional profiles of heterogeneous samples often reflect changes in proportions of individual cell types. Several robust techniques have been developed to dissect the composition of such mixed samples given transcriptional signatures of the pure components or their proportions. These approaches are insufficient, however, in situations when no information about individual mixture components is available. This problem is known as the  complete deconvolution problem, where the composition is revealed without any a priori knowledge about cell types and their proportions. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized property of tissue-specific genes – their mutual linearity – and use it to reveal the structure of the topological space of mixed transcriptional profiles and provide a noise-robust approach to the complete deconvolution problem. Furthermore, our analysis reveals systematic bias of all deconvolution techniques due to differences in cell size or RNA-content, and we demonstrate how to address this bias at the experimental design level.},
