	abstract = {We give improved constants for data dependent and variance sensitive conﬁdence bounds, called empirical Bernstein bounds, and extend these inequalities to hold uniformly over classes of functions whose growth function is polynomial in the sample size n. The bounds lead us to consider sample variance penalization, a novel learning method which takes into account the empirical variance of the loss function. We give conditions under which sample variance penalization is effective. In particular, we present a bound on the excess risk incurred by the method. Using this, we argue that there are situations in which the excess risk of our memetphioridcailsriosfkomrdineirm1i/znat,iownhiisleofthoerdeexrc1es/s√rnis.kWoef show some experimental results, which conﬁrm the theory. Finally, we discuss the potential application of our results to sample compression schemes.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03167},
	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2009.03167},
	abstract = {Conﬁdence sequences, anytime p-values (called p-processes in this paper), and e-processes all enable sequential inference for composite and nonparametric classes of distributions at arbitrary stopping times. Examining the literature, one ﬁnds that at the heart of all these (quite diﬀerent) approaches has been the identiﬁcation of nonnegative (super)martingales. Thus, informally, nonnegative (super)martingales are known to be suﬃcient for anytime-valid sequential inference, even in composite and nonparametric settings. Our central contribution is to show that nonnegative martingales are also universal—after appropriately deﬁning admissibility, we show that all admissible constructions of conﬁdence sequences, p-processes, or e-processes must necessarily utilize nonnegative martingales. Our proofs utilize several modern mathematical tools for composite testing and estimation problems: max-martingales, Snell envelopes, transﬁnite induction, and new Doob-Lévy martingales make appearances in previously unencountered ways. Informally, if one wishes to perform anytime-valid sequential inference, then any existing approach can be recovered or dominated using nonnegative martingales. We provide several nontrivial examples, with special focus on testing symmetry, where our new constructions render past methods inadmissible. We also prove the subGaussian supermartingale to be admissible.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2010.09686},
	abstract = {This paper derives conﬁdence intervals (CI) and time-uniform conﬁdence sequences (CS) for the classical problem of estimating an unknown mean from bounded observations. We present a general approach for deriving concentration bounds, that can be seen as a generalization and improvement of the celebrated Chernoﬀ method. At its heart, it is based on a class of composite nonnegative martingales, with strong connections to testing by betting and the method of mixtures. We show how to extend these ideas to sampling without replacement, another heavily studied problem. In all cases, our bounds are adaptive to the unknown variance, and empirically vastly outperform existing approaches based on Hoeﬀding or empirical Bernstein inequalities and their recent supermartingale generalizations by Howard et al. [39]. In short, we establish a new state-ofthe-art for four fundamental problems: CSs and CIs for bounded means, when sampling with and without replacement.},
